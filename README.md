# formhandler_cleverreach
Flexible CleverReach Formular API for sign in/out for TYPO3

This fork works with TYPO3 > 7.x and formhandler > 2.3.0 . 
If you like to use with older formhandler, you have to un-comment the protected function getCheckFailed() in Cleverreachemail.php

Actually patched for TYPO3 9.5.x - maybe working
